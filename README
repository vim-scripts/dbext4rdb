If DBEXT_506_RDB.ZIP was installed, please verify it was not installed into
any of the vim70 or vim71 directories.  All plugins should be installed into
the .vim (Unix) or vimfiles (Windows) directories.  If you find any of the
dbext files in the vim7x directories, please remove these before installing
the official version.
